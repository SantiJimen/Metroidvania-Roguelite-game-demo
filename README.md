This is the code for my Final Thesis. 

It is a game demo that contains elements of Metroidvania games while using the proceduraly generated maps of a Roguelite. It works but it's still very barebones.

None of the sprites are mine, there is only one power up aviable, 3 levels, 1 boss fight, the enemy AI is too simplistic and the run animation isn't consistent. I would also like 
to add a reward and shop system and add some better pathmaking for the enemies.

That said I am pretty happy with the map generation, even though that could also be improved.
